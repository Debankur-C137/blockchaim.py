# Learn Blockchains by BuildingÂ One

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dvf/blockchain.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dvf/blockchain)

This is the source code for my post on [Building a Blockchain](https://medium.com/p/117428612f46). 

## Installation

1. Make sure [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is installed. 
2. Install [pipenv](https://github.com/kennethreitz/pipenv). 

```
$ pip install pipenv 
```
3. Install requirements  
```
$ pipenv install 
``` 

4. Run the server:
    * `$ pipenv run python blockchain.py` 
    * `$ pipenv run python blockchain.py -p 5001`
    * `$ pipenv run python blockchain.py --port 5002`
    

## Installation (C# Implementation)

1. Install a free copy of Visual Studio IDE (Community Edition):
https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/

2. Once installed, open the solution file (BlockChain.sln) using the File > Open > Project/Solution menu options within Visual Studio.

3. From within the "Solution Explorer", right click the BlockChain.Console project and select the "Set As Startup Project" option.

4. Click the "Start" button, or hit F5 to run. The program executes in a console window, and is controlled via HTTP with the same commands as the Python version.
